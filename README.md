# Fear and Luminescence on a New York Bike Trail
### Lede Student Project  

#### BACKGROUND
This was a project that was done for Lede's mapping class taught by <a href = "https://www.aaronreiss.com/">Aaron Reiss.</a>
The assignment was to physically collect data by walking around, noting an observation and building a story from that observation. Just the weekend before this project was assigned, my parents and I had gotten into a heated argument about how I was "inviting problems upon myself" by bicycling late at night. I initially chose the topic "Biking late at night" to use data to demonstrate to my parents that they had nothing to worry about. My plan was to bike down the path, videotape the entire trip with the camera directed down the path, and then utilize the light reflected on the ground as a measure to depict the journey. But something about this ride was different.  <br/><br/>
Collecting data about light in the route made me aware that I was afraid during parts of this ride. These reactions were not new, but because they were focused at the beginning of the journey, I realized that I would just conveniently forget by conclusion of the ride that I was ever afraid. This exercise in gathering light data inadvertently compelled me to gather data on my fears and reasons behind these feelings as well.

#### TOOLS USED
I used <b>Strava</b> to map the ride back from campus, exported the gpx file from the app into <b>geojson.io</b> to collect the json data. I then uploaded this data into <b>Mapbox</b> to create a map. I used <b>Adobe Photoshop</b> to create a featuring effect to focus the map on the location I was concerned about. I used <b>Adobe Illustrator</b> to create gradients and mark up the map. I used <b>Scrollama.js</b> to create a scrolly-telling webpage.
